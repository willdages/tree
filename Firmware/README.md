Firmware
---

This firmware needs to be uploaded as a new app through the [Particle Dashboard](http://build.particle.io).

1. Create a new app
2. Search for the 'WS2801' library and add it to your new app
3. The Particle dashboard will automatically add an import statement to the top of your app. This is included wiht the `tree.ino` file, so don't worry about overwriting it in the next step.
4. Select everything in your new app and replace it with the contents of `tree.ino`.
5. Select your Photon/Core in the device picker and then deploy the app.
